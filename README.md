# First Responder Process in Digital Forensics

## Definition
A **First Responder** is the first individual (IT staff, law enforcement, or analyst) to arrive at the scene of a cyber incident. Their main goal is to identify, isolate, secure, and preserve digital evidence without altering it.

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Identification
- Recognize the occurrence of a digital incident (intrusion, data theft, malware).
- Classify the nature and severity of the incident.
- Alert the appropriate incident response team if needed.

### 2. Isolation
- Disconnect affected systems from the network **without powering them off**.
- Prevent further access by users or malware.
- Ensure volatile data is preserved if possible.

### 3. Documentation
- Log **time, date, and actions** taken from the moment of arrival.
- Record the physical setup, visible screen contents, cable connections, etc.
- Photograph the scene if necessary.

### 4. Evidence Preservation
- Avoid any action that could modify the original data.
- Create forensic images using write blockers.
- Use hash values (e.g., SHA-256) to verify integrity.

### 5. Chain of Custody
- Label all evidence with timestamps, handler info, and purpose.
- Secure evidence physically and digitally.
- Maintain a detailed custody log from collection to court presentation.

### 6. Handoff
- Transfer all data and documentation to the **digital forensics team**.
- Provide a summary report of actions taken during first response.
- Assist investigators with contextual or system-specific information.
